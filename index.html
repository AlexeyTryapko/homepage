                    &mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like
                    me.
                    Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but my
                    IQ is
                    one of the highest ― and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                    fault.

                    Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates and
                    other bureaucracy, but
                    program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98%
                    students gave
                    positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
                    Trump University after
                    the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                    Avenue. I sure do like

                    Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in USA and abroad! Also
                    switched to the Reform

                    Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on
                    Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building

                    Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America not great

                    and boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot
                    of cash in 1995)

                    I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you
                    pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                    rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because
                    she is another Trump!

                    I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and filed
                    an antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now, but
                    back then they were great!

                    Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish
                    workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                    architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
                    interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a
                    repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95
                    million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
